<b>Fonts</b>
<hr>
Type faces in FOX are manipulated using <B>FXFont</B> objects.&nbsp;
To provide a consistent look and feel for all applications, most FOX widgets
normally share one common font object, which is automatically adopted when
the widget is constructed.&nbsp; However, a widget's font is readily changed
using the setFont() member function.&nbsp; Changing fonts on widgets will
automatically cause an adjustment in layout so that the new size of the
widget is accomodated.
<P>As with most other resources such as FXIcon and FXCursor etc., building
FXFont objects also takes <B><I>two</I></B> steps:- <B><I>construction</I></B>
of the client-side part of the font object, followed by <B><I>creation</I></B>
of the corresponding server-side part.&nbsp;&nbsp; During construction,
all necessary information is supplied to the FXFont object so that the
desired font may be located and loaded into memory during the creation.
<P>In most cases, the font objects are automatically created when the widget
that uses it is being created.&nbsp; If you have constructed a new FXFont
object later on, however, you may have to make a call to the font object's
<TT>create()</TT>
member function to make sure the font object is fully initialized.
<P>As different computer systems may have different fonts, it is possible
that the specific font your application needs may not be available.&nbsp;
Since you probably still would like this application to run anyway, alternative
fonts must be found.
<P>FOX supports mechanisms to localize fonts which are ``close'' [in some
easthetic sense] to the desired font, so that applications will typically
not fail simply because of missing fonts.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however,
that the information you supplied to the FXFont contructor may not accurately
reflect the font that is actually being used in your application.
<P>Also note that information about a font will not be available until
after the font has been created using <TT>create()</TT>.
<p>
<p>
<b>Using Font Objects</b>
<hr>
Using fonts is really very easy.&nbsp; For example, to build a Button
Control with a different Font for the caption, you would use the following
C++ code:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" BGCOLOR="#FFF8E1" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD><TT>FXButton *button = new FXButton(parent,"&amp;Caption");</TT>
<P><TT>FXFont* captionfont = new FXFont(app,"times",24);</TT>
<P><TT>button->setFont(captionfont);</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>This statements will create a Button with caption ``<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+2><U>C</U>aption</FONT></FONT></B>''
and use a font of <B><I>24</I></B> points <B><I>Times</I></B>.&nbsp; Note
that in this case we assume that the captionfont will be created in the
process of creating the Button; if you were to change fonts after the application
has already started running, you would want to call <TT>captionfont->create()</TT>
to make sure the font resources are created.
<P>Also note that font objects may be <B><I>shared</I></B> between several
controls; thus, you don't have to create a different font object for each
control [unless of course you want to use a different font!].
<P>In the above example, we have taken default values for many parameters
influencing the choice of font. The above call is actually equivalent to:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" BGCOLOR="#FFF8E1" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD><TT>FXFont* captionfont = new FXFont(app,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"times",</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
24,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FONTWEIGHT_NORMAL,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FONTSLANT_REGULAR,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FONTENCODING_DEFAULT,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0);</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>That is to say, construct a font with face name ``times,'' 24 points,
normal weight [not bold], no italics, and use whatever character encoding
is available for this font; finally, the zero (0) indicates there are no
hints.
<P>Besides the above platform-independent font constructor, FXFont also
has an alternative constructor which is only applicable to the X11 Window
System; this method bypasses the font matching algorithm.
<P>Assuming that our display was 75 dots per inch (dpi), the alternative
method of contructing fonts using the X11 font string would have been:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" BGCOLOR="#FFF8E1" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD><TT>FXFont* captionfont = new FXFont(app,"-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--24-240-75-75-p-124-iso8859-1");</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>Besides being harder to remember, this method would not port over very
well to other systems, or systems where this particular font is not available.&nbsp;
However, there are a few reasons why sometimes you may need this method:
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
You want to make sure you obtain a <I>specific font</I>, and do not want
the matching algorithm to get in the way;</LI>

<LI>
You need to obtain certain raster-based <I>system fonts,</I> for example
"9x15bold."</LI>
</OL>

<p>
<p>
<b>Font Matching and Substitution</b>
<hr>
In order to be able to write applications which may be ported to a large
variety of computer systems and software environments, it is necessary
to make sure that the absence of certain fonts is handled gracefully.
<BR>The FXFont implementation offers a number of benefits that allow you
to get your application running under a wide variety of&nbsp; environments,
even on systems where very few fonts have been installed:
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Font Substitution.</B>&nbsp; Font substitution is used to map type face
names which may be hard-coded in your application to another type face
name, so an alternative font may be used without having to make changes
to programs or recompiling them.&nbsp; FOX uses the standard <A HREF="registry.html#REGISTRY">Registry</A>
mechanism to map one type face name to another.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Font Matching.</B>&nbsp; Font matching algorithms are used to determine
the closest available font to the desired font.&nbsp; Different weighting
factors are applied to different font attributes to get the best visual
approximation.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Font Match Hints.</B>&nbsp; Hints may be passed to the matching algorithms
so you are able to emphasize certain types of font attributes more strongly
than others.</LI>

<LI>
<B>X11 Font String.</B>&nbsp; Platform-dependent fonts may be directly
specified also.&nbsp; This method is not recommended unless you need to
select a specific font, and are not interested in portability.</LI>
</OL>
Before trying to acquire a list of available fonts for a certain type face,
the FXFont implementation first tries a substitution for the <B><I>type
face nam</I></B>e.&nbsp; The standard FOX registry is used to make this
association.&nbsp; The substitute font is found in the section FONTSUBSTITUTIONS
of the registry.
<BR>For example, the following fragment decribes the registry settings
which would replace ``swiss'' by ``helvetica'' and ``new century schoolbook''
by ``courier'':
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" BGCOLOR="#FFF8E1" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD>[FONTSUBSTITUTIONS]
<BR>swiss = helvetica
<BR>new century schoolbook =&nbsp; courier
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;Thus, you can easily give a FOX application another font even
if you might not have the source code around!
<P>After having substituted the type face name, the FXFont implementation
tries to find the font from the given type face&nbsp; that best matches
the parameters and hints.&nbsp; Parameters or hints which are given a ``don't
care'' value are considered matched.&nbsp; For example, if you specify
FONTWEIGHT_DONTCARE for the font weight, all font weights would match and
the resulting font will be based on other parameters.
<P>Not all parameters have the same priority as far as matching goes; the
importance of the parameters is as follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Character Set Encoding.&nbsp;</B> If you needed East European character
sets and you got Greek instead, even all other things being equal, you'd
be disappointed.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Fixed</B> or <B>Variable Pitch</B> hints.&nbsp; For programming editors,
for example, fixed pitch fonts are a must so that indentation is properly
maintained; therefore, font pitch is quite important for legibility purposes.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Screen Resolution</B>.&nbsp; Bitmapped fonts are much more readable
when the resolution matches that of your screen; so resolution is quite
important.&nbsp; The FXFont implementation tries to determine the screen's
resolution (in terms of <B><I>dots per inch</I></B>) and then match fonts
designed for this resolution.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Scalable Font Hint</B>.&nbsp; Certain operations such as scaling and
shearing [obliqueing] are only possible with scalable fonts; thus, if you
have specified this hint, all other things being equal, you'd prefer scalable
fonts over other ones.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Polymorphic Font Hint.</B> Polymorphic fonts allow continuous variations
in various attributes of a font, such as set width, weight, slant, and
others. If your application needs such fonts for certain effects, this
much be made to match.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Point Size</B>. When all the above are satisfied, you certainly want
the size of the font to be roughly equal to the one specified.&nbsp; For
scalable fonts, you can of course virtually always match the requested
size exactly.&nbsp; For non-scalable fonts, the FXFont implementation matches
the largest font which is less than or equal to the desired size.&nbsp;
Even though a larger font may be closer, the larger one may be too large
for proper layout on a finite screen; therefore, the implementation yields
only smaller fonts.&nbsp; As the resolution has influence over the observed
point size, the implementation corrects for this [see ``<A HREF="#SCREENRES">Screen
Resolution</A>'' below].</LI>

<LI>
<B>Weight.&nbsp;</B> The weight or ``boldness'' of the font.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Slant. </B>Oblique and italic may both be matched for a slanted font.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Set Width. </B>Wide or narrow (condensed) printing.</LI>
</OL>
After having tried all the members of the specified type face, if no match
is found at all, the FXFont implementation tries a number of other common
fonts, based on additional hints:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
If no hints are given, or if the hint <B>FONTHINT_SWISS</B> is given, the
face ``helvetica'' or its substitution will be tried;</LI>

<LI>
Next, if no hint is given or if the hint given is <B>FONTHINT_ROMAN</B>,
the face ``times'' or its substitution will be tried;</LI>

<LI>
Next, if no hint given or if the given hint was equal to <B>FONTHINT_MODERN,</B>
the face ``courier'' or its substitution will be tried;</LI>

<LI>
After that, if no hint is given or if the hint was <B>FONTHINT_DECORATIVE</B>,
the face ``gothic'' or its substitution will be tried;</LI>

<LI>
Finally, if all else fails, the implementation will try a number of ``fallback
fonts'' which have been determined to be commonly available.</LI>
</UL>
If all the above failed, yet there is at least one font on your system,
then you should report this problem on the FOX mailing list...
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><A NAME="SCREENRES"></A>
<p>
<p>
<b>Screen Resolution</b>
<hr>
Since current-day analog monitors can stretch and shrink the visible
field of the display, the actual resolution is typically not exactly 75dpi
or 100dpi.&nbsp; To get a font's point size as close to the desired pointsize
as possible, FOX adjusts for the actual screen dpi relative to the font's
dpi.
<BR>For example, suppose we have a font such as:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-<B><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">120</FONT></B>-<B><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">75</FONT></B>-<B><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">75</FONT></B>-p-70-iso8859-1</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>This font is a <B><I>12-point</I></B> font designed for a <B><I>75
dpi</I></B> device.&nbsp; If your monitor however is set to display 90
dpi, the font would be too small.&nbsp; The implementation can correct
for this by multiplying the font's point size by (75/90) which means visually
this font would actually be more like 10-points on your monitor.&nbsp;
Thus, to get a font <I>designed</I> for 100 dpi to <I>display</I> as 12
points on your monitor, we should search for a font which is slightly <I>larger</I>
than 12-point; to be exact, we should be looking for a font (90/75)*12
= 14.4-point font.
<P>On many systems such as work stations, the machine is shipped with accurate
information about the particular monitor supplied with the system;&nbsp;
on such systems, the font implementation of FOX will correctly determine
the right resolution to use.&nbsp; On PC's however, hardware is mixed and
matched from different sources, and the reported screen sizes may be incorrect,
causing fonts to bigger or smaller than requested.
<P>When the system reports the wrong resolution, you can easily correct
that by setting the resolution yourself using the registry database. On
my system, for example, the XFree86 X Server reports 75 dpi, while I really
have 100dpi.&nbsp; So I change my registry database as follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" BGCOLOR="#FFF8E1" NOSAVE >
<TR>
<TD>
<BR>[SETTINGS]
<BR>screenxres = 100
<BR>screenyres =&nbsp; 100
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>These entries need to go into the ``<B><I>Desktop</I></B>'' file so
that all FOX programs will be aware of this, regardless of vendor or application
name.&nbsp; For more about the registry, see the section on <A HREF="registry.html#REGISTRY">FXRegistry</A>.
