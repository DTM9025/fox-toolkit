<P>FOX is a C++ based Toolkit for developing Graphical User Interfaces
easily and effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; It offers a wide, and growing, collection
of Controls, and provides state of the art facilities such as <I>drag and
drop</I>, <I>selection</I>, as well as <I>OpenGL</I> widgets for 3D graphical
manipulation.&nbsp; FOX also implements <I>icons</I>, <I>images</I>, and
user-convenience features such as <I>status line help, </I>and<I> tooltips.&nbsp;</I>
Tooltips may even be used for 3D objects!
<P>Considerable importance has been placed on making FOX one of the fastest
toolkits around, and to minimize memory use:- FOX uses a number of techniques
to speed up drawing and spatial layout of the GUI.&nbsp; Memory is conserved
by allowing programmers to create and destroy GUI elements on the fly.
<P>Even though FOX offers a large collection of Controls already, FOX leverages
C++ to allow programmers to easily build additional Controls and GUI elements,
simply by taking existing controls, and creating a derived class which
simply adds or redefines the desired behavior.
<P>One of the prime design goals of FOX is the <I>ease of programming</I>;
thus, most controls can be created using a single line of C++ code; most
parameters have sensible default values, so that they may be omitted, and
layout managers ensure that designers of GUI's do not have to worry about
precise alignments.
<P>Another nice feature of FOX which significantly reduces the number of
lines of code which have to be written is FOX's ability to have widgets
connect to each other, and passing certain commands between them; for example,
a menu entry Hide Toolbar can be directly <I>connected</I> to the Toolbar,
and cause it to hide.
<P>Finally, FOX makes it easy to maintain the state of the GUI in an application
by having the GUI elements automatically updating themselves by interrogating
the application's state.&nbsp; This feature eliminates the large amount
of effort that may go into sensitizing, graying out, checking/unchecking
etc. depending on the application state.
