<P><U><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+4>Goals.</FONT></FONT></U>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Developing a single application for multiple platforms
is a difficult task.&nbsp; The most significant issue is the need for a
clean solution for developing Graphical User Interfaces [GUI's].&nbsp;&nbsp;
FOX aims to address this by providing a single GUI library that can run
on different computer hardware and operating system environments.&nbsp;
The benefits to application vendors and developers are clear:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Development effort to support multiple environments
is substantially reduced.</B>&nbsp; After development, your FOX based application
is only a compile away from running on other operating systems.&nbsp; When
multiple hardware and software combinations are required by customers operating
in a heterogeneous environment, using a single GUI system such as FOX is
clearly the most cost-effective method to achieve the goal.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Availability of your software on other platforms
will engender additional revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Without the necessity
of additional development&nbsp; work, the cost of&nbsp; which would have
to be amortized over the number of sales, additional revenues can be engendered
by having your software be available on multiple hardware and software
environments.&nbsp; Software development is a costly undertaking; because
of this, software vendors typically limit the number of platforms to a
small subset of the platforms being used by <I>all</I> customers, effectively
leaving certain customers in the dark.&nbsp; FOX allows applications to
be developed on one platform, then simply recompile the application on
a number of other hardware/software systems.&nbsp; Because the cost of
doing so is negligible, this approach will be able to generate positive
cashflow even with low sales volumes.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Captive audience.</B>&nbsp; If the application
you're developing is available on all platforms, you may be able to create
a captive customer base on hardware/software systems where your competitor
is absent; you may in fact even be able to charge premium prices.&nbsp;
Using the additional revenues derived from these customers, your product
will be able to derive a steady addional revenue stream which will allow
you to compete more aggressively against your single-platform competitor.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Higher Quality.</B> For programmers, the benefits
of multi-platform development v.s. single platform development are the
additional confidence and code quality that compiling under different environments
will give.&nbsp; For example, I have compiled FOX on a number of different
systems, and different compilers will discover different types of code
bugs.&nbsp; By compiling on all these different systems, FOX has gotten
quite a bit better in the course of time.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<U><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+4>Approach.</FONT></FONT></U>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">FOX attains the goal of platform independence
by eliminating all&nbsp; system dependencies from its public interfaces.&nbsp;
In fact, a typical FOX application may not even need to include any system-specific
header files at all!&nbsp; By not including e.g. X-Windows header files,
applications can not even accidentally slip up and introduce platform dependencies.
This strategy is also carried out inside FOX itself.&nbsp; Thus, large
parts of FOX are in fact defined entirely in FOX itself.&nbsp; The only
dependencies are concentrated in a few select base classes where this couldn't
be avoided.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The following salient points highlight some fundamental
benefits of FOX <I>vis-a-vis</I> other purported platform independent toolkits:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Eliminate all platform specific header files</B>.&nbsp;
Applications should only include header files from FOX, and a few header
files for such basic system services as opening files etc.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Internal Layering. </B>FOX itself relies largely
on FOX base classes, and therefore a large fraction of FOX itself is platform
independent as well.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Rely only on `<I>Bedrock</I>' system facilities.
</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">FOX
relies only on core system facilities, and does NOT wrap native GUI libraries
or toolkits.&nbsp; This has the following benefits:</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Identical behaviour.</B> The behaviour will be
close to identical on all systems, as the behaviour is completely controlled
by the FOX implementation, rather than some underlying library.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Identical looks. </B>FOX applications will look
the same no matter what system you're running it on.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ability to <I>subclass</I>.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;
Because FOX is written from the ground up in C++, and is NOT a C++ wrapper
around some other legacy toolkit or library, FOX Controls may be subclassed
and extended by application programmers.&nbsp; Moreover, if these additions
can be done by calling upon FOX built-in facilities, those additions will
be platform independent also.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Higer Quality.</B> It is a given in software development that those
facilities which are most frequently used are the ones which are most stable.&nbsp;
Thus, by using core system facilities instead of higher-level transient
API's, the impact of the underlying system's instability is minimized.&nbsp;
A chain is as strong as the weakest link, and while I can not control the
quality of the links, I can minimize the number of them.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Higher Speed.&nbsp;</B> Eliminating layers between
FOX and the underlying system not only increases the application's quality,
it will also make it faster, and reduce memory overhead.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Go to the Bedrock.</B> FOX's core facilities needed
from the target system are things like mouse/keyboard event handling, and
basic graphics facilities such as drawing of lines and rectangles [and
some other system facilities].&nbsp; In most operating systems, these are
fairly mature API's and not subject to much change.&nbsp; If you want to
build a big building, you need to go down to the solid bedrock.&nbsp; This
is what FOX does.</FONT></LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>FOX is extensible.</B>&nbsp; The FOX library is designed to be open-ended
and extensible. What this means is that unlike other libraries which take
the approach of wrapping legacy GUI toolkits, FOX may be extended with
<I>Custom
Controls</I> and Widgets which will set your application apart from the
others.&nbsp; Building Custom Controls is extremely easy in FOX, as it
is essentially just C++ subclassing.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>FOX is available under Library GNU Public License.
</B>Since
FOX is distributed in source form under LGPL, you have the ability to make
changes or extensions to FOX to suit your needs.&nbsp; Having FOX inspected
by 1000's of programmers all over the world will iron out any bugs it may
have very quickly.&nbsp; This process is already under way.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">I care a great deal about software quality; I imagine,
so do you.&nbsp; In the course of my programming life, I have ran into
many situations where the bugs I needed to fix were not in my own code,
but in someone else's, and of course I didn't have the source.&nbsp; Thus,
the quality of my own software was limited by the quality of someone else's.&nbsp;
Problem is, the developers of the libraries and software I depend on are
frequently not motivated to make their software correct.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This has made me a firm believer in the <I>GPL</I>
or <I>Open Source</I> model of software development. FOX was started in
part because I didn't want to explain to our customers that the reason
X or Y didn't work was because of the broken software or libraries on their
machine.&nbsp; The only way one can create high-quality applications is
to bring as much of the underlying system under control as possible.&nbsp;
Hence the <I>Go to the Bedrock </I>philosophy.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">FOX is not perfect.&nbsp; But it has the advantage
that I can fix its imperfections as soon as they are discovered.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><A NAME="WINNT"></A><U><FONT COLOR="#990000"><FONT SIZE=+4>Why Windows
NT?</FONT></FONT></U>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Some people may argue that porting FOX to Windows ``helps'' Microsoft.&nbsp;
It doesn't.&nbsp; Porting FOX to Windows NT <I>does</I> however help <I>application
vendors</I>:- instead of subjugating to a proprietary lock-in GUI environment,
they can now ship their application on a large variety of platforms, like
LINUX, and this with little or no additional effort, and derive additional
revenues.
<P>In addition, being distributed under LGPL, it lowers costs, and does
not incur any license fees for distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being distributed
under LGPL also has the concomittant benefit that a large number of people
may inspect the source code, and spot its inevitable deficiencies; thus,
more bugs are found and they are found more quickly.&nbsp; Remember, the
person which is the most motivated to fix a bug is the one bitten by it;
under the Open Source development model, this person can actually localize,
and possibly fix the bug himself, and <A HREF="mailto:fox-users@cfdrc.com">contribute</A>
those changes to the library.
<P>Finally, I believe application developers will find the FOX library
a more attractive alternative.&nbsp; For a software developer, the FOX
Library is far more easy to learn, and offers some unique benefits, such
as tying Widgets [Controls] together with little effort, being able to
subclass from existing Widgets to make custom ones, and last but not least
the ability to modify FOX's source code itself if necessary.&nbsp; FOX
represents what I consider to be the ideal GUI Library; I wrote FOX to
use it myself!
