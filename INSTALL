                                The FOX GUI Library Installation
                                ================================
                                
                                


For LINUX systems.
==================

You will need to install the MESA graphics library.  FOX is being developed
on RedHat 5.1+Mesa-devel-2.6 RPM.  It is known to work with Mesa 2.5 also.
I recommend Mesa 2.6 or above, as FOX will take advantage of the Mesa ``swap-hack''
to increase redrawing performance.


./configure --with-opengl=mesa



For other UNIX systems.
=======================

For other unix systems which have OpenGL installed, you can type:

./configure --with-opengl



If you need to compile FOX with debugging enabled, add the --enable-debug
option also when running configure.

After configure runs its course, simply type ``make'' to build the library.


FOX should compile on most unix platforms; we have tested the following:
SGI, IBM, HP, SUN, DEC, all with gcc; however, FOX uses a fairly conservative
subset of C++, and should be no problem to port to other, more primitive, C++
compilers.

On SGI IRIX 6.4, use: CC.clean -n32

When programming against FOX, you should only have to include "fx.h", and
for 3D programs, "fx3d.h".  To use keyboard symbols, include "fxkeys.h" also.
Specifically, to remain portable application programs should NOT include any X
window header files.

You may of course need other system headers ("stdio.h", "gl.h", etc).
